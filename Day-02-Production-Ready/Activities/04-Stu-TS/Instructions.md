### Jump into TypeScript

* Go to https://www.typescriptlang.org
* Click on 'playground' at the top

Put the following function into the playground
```
function greeter(person: string) {
    return "Hello, " + person;
}

let user = "Jane User";

greeter(user);
```

Change user to a number.

Look at the error.

Add a return type to the greeter function

With extra time, play around with the playground or investigate the handbook https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html
